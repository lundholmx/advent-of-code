# Advent of Code

Code for AoC challenges.

## 2021

Solutions for 2021 (up to day 22, part 1) are written in Python.\
Requires:

- Python 3.10+
- Just (optional)

Install requirements into python virtual env:
```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running

Use the just recipy `run`:
```sh
# Run solution for day 12, year 2021
just run 12
...
```

## 2022

I had a different goal for 2022 - use as many languages as possible!

Goals:
- [x] Bash (day 1)
- [ ] AWK
- [ ] C
- [ ] C#
- [ ] F#
- [ ] Lisp
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Elixir
- [ ] Lua
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Julia

[2022](./2022) should contain a recipy for each day to run.

That is, use:
```sh
cd 2022
just run day13 # Run solution for day 13
```
